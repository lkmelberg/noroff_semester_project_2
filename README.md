# Semester Project 2 - Noroff VOC

This was my second semester project for my frontend degree from noroff. We were to use what we have learned so far in our studies and apply it to the project. The site is an auction site, and we were to use a CSS framework, and a given api.

# Brief / Description

## Goal

To take the skills learned over the past three semesters and create an auction website.

An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.

When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.
Requirements

    All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project only covers the front-end application for the API.
